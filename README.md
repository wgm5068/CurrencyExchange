# CurrencyExchange
Rewritten version of a simple currency exchange program done myself in my free time. I used this project as a learning experience to help me better understand how valuable APIs could be in applications. 


This program was originally written when ExchangeRateAPI did not require a subscription to set a base currency. This version has not been updated to allow users to convert USD to a given currency, rather it uses the EUR as the base.
